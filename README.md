## Vision

**Exploring the limits of AI Agent complete control over system resources for automation.**

Built on Claude Code's mature context engineering framework, Claude Co-Desk represents a new paradigm in AI automation - moving beyond simple code generation to true system-level task automation where AI agents can orchestrate complex workflows with near 100% completion rates.

### Beyond Traditional AI Tools - The Unconventional Path

While others use Claude Code for development assistance, Claude Co-Desk explores uncharted territory - transforming AI from a coding companion into an autonomous revenue generation engine. We've deliberately chosen the unconventional path, pushing Claude Code's capabilities far beyond its intended scope to create digital employees that generate real business income.

This isn't incremental improvement. This is a fundamental reimagining of what AI can accomplish when given system-level autonomy and business objectives.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**1. Install Claude Code CLI**

Visit [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) and follow the official installation instructions for your platform.

**2. Verify Installation**
```bash
claude --version  # Should show version info
claude auth      # Follow prompts to authenticate
```

**3. Python Environment**
```bash
python --version  # Requires Python 3.8+
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HammerGPT/claude-co-desk.git
cd claude-co-desk
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

4. **Access the application:**

**Local Access:**
